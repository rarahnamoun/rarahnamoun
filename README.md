# Hi there üëã I'm Rashin Rahnamoun

I'm a Computer Engineering student passionate about **Natural Language Processing** and **Human-Computer Interaction**. I enjoy building projects that bridge the gap between complex algorithms and practical applications.

## üöÄ What I Work On

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Implementing algorithms from scratch including Decision Trees, Neural Networks, CNNs, and clustering methods for various supervised and unsupervised learning tasks
- **Computer Vision**: Developing projects with OCR, image classification, segmentation using U-Net, and generative modeling with VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Building text classification systems, tokenizers for low-resource languages, and exploring graph-theoretical frameworks for language models
- **Complex Networks & Graph Theory**: Investigating network robustness, traffic load analysis, and applying graph theory to microservice architectures and lifetime distributions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I Use

**Languages**: Python, C/C++, Java, MATLAB  
**ML/AI**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers, OpenCV, NetworkX  
**Web**: React, Vue, HTML/CSS  
**Other**: Arduino, Unity, Flutter

## üìä Current Focus

I'm currently exploring the intersection of graph theory and machine learning, working on projects that analyze network behaviors and develop novel approaches for understanding complex systems.
