# About Me

Hi there! I'm Rashin Rahnamoun

I'm a passionate developer with a focus on natural language processing and HCI. Through my projects, I explore building models from scratch to tackle real-world challenges like text classification, image synthesis, and graph analysis. Check out my repositories to see hands-on implementations using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more.

## Projects

- **Machine Learning Projects**: Implementations of core algorithms like Decision Trees, SVM, CNNs, and clustering techniques applied to diverse datasets.
- **Computer Vision Projects**: From OCR systems to generative models like GANs and diffusion models for segmentation and synthesis.
- **Multi-Class Text Classification**: Fine-tuned BERT and LSTM for movie genre prediction, with custom Naive Bayes outperforming baselines.
- **Tokenizer Generator**: A tool for creating tokenizers tailored to low-resource or corrupted text using LLMs.
- **Lifetime Distributions**: Graph Neural Networks for analyzing aging properties in statistical distributions.
- **Traffic Load of Graphs**: Studying network resilience under attacks with visualizations in Dash.
